# Flights

A simple app that allows users to check flight arrival and departure destinations defined in a local database. This application aims to demonstrate working with SQL databases and preferences datastore along with other libraries when developing an actual Android application. It's what I've come up with as an answer to the project challenge at the end of unit 6 of the [Google Android Developer tutorials](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-flight-search).

## Implementation Details

The app is written in Kotlin and uses the Jetpack Compose UI framework. The implementation adheres to the clean architecture principle, emphasizing its robustness and maintainability. For those curious about the specific tools and libraries utilized, please find them listed below:

1. RoomDB - contains the flight data
2. DataStore - for storing the search query
3. Navigation - navigating between screens
4. Kapt and KSP - annotation processing
5. Hilt - dependency injection
6. Splash - splash screen
